COPYRIGHT ABANDONMENT

I Natasha Otomoski (the original author) hereby abandon ('waive') all my
copyright with respect to the computer program named Haircomb Core and all my
associated rights defined by the Berne Convention of 9 September 1886, including,
but not limited to, copyrights in the work and to any derivative works. I
fundamentally disagree with the concept of copyright and it is laughable to me
that someone thinks that a person like me would want to have some right of this
type and limit the freedom of others by means of this right. I believe that
writing this is overt enough act to make this surrender of my rights clear and
explicit, on the day of publication.

I also abandon the right to revoke abandonment of this right, if possible,
because I never intend to change my mind about this.
